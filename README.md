[Mailchain](https://github.com/mailchain/mailchain) enables blockchain-based email-like messaging with plain or rich text and attachment capabilities. Using blockchain protocols and decentralized storage, Mailchain delivers a simple, secure, messaging experience.

Account holders or owners of a public address often need to communicate in the context of the account or public address. Communication may relate to transactions, account actions or some type of notification.

Examples of use cases for blockchain messaging include invoicing, receipts, contacting users of a service or application developers.

The majority of blockchain protocols provide no standard way to handle messaging. Some account holders have sent messages as an encrypted or unencrypted string included in transaction data. Some applications work around the problem by asking users to link another method of contact \(e.g. email address, phone number etc.\) to an application. This compromises anonymity by asking users to link or reveal an identity. It also increases exposure to security risks, and relies on additional centralized services.

Visit [Getting Started](getting-started.md) to install the application and start sending and receiving messages.
