## Configuring your own storage

### Setting Up Amazon S3

Mailchain will support multiple sent storage options. Currently Amazon S3 is the only supported storage. Amazon S3 can be configure either through the console, via the CLI, or with CloudFormation. We recommend using CloudFormation, to make this easier we have supplied a [template](https://github.com/mailchain/sent-storage-s3) you can run in your account. The easiest way to create this resource is by clicking on the launch stack icon below.

> **ATTENTION**: We are working to remove the requirement of having to configure Amazon S3 for sent storage , you can track the progress at [this issue](https://github.com/mailchain/mailchain/issues/119). Subscribe to notifications to track our progress.

You are now ready to [initialize](/app-init) the application.
